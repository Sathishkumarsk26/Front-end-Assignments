    <p class="one nine"> Atoms of radioactive elements can split. According to Albert Einstein, mass and energy are interchangeable under
        certain circumstances. When atoms split, the process is called nuclear fission. In this case, a small amount of
        mass is converted into energy. Thus the energy released cannot do much damage. However, several subatomic
        particles called neutrons are also emitted during this process. Each neutron will hit a radioactive element
        releasing more neutrons in the process. This causes a chain reaction and creates a large amount of energy. This
        energy is converted into heat which expands uncontrollably causing an explosion. Hence, atoms do not literally
        explode. They generate energy that can cause explosions.</p>
    <p class="one two"> Since March 8, 1990, Women’s Day has been observed by SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation)
        comprising seven countries namely India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The day is
        celebrated to highlight the problems of the girl child in these countries. It is very sad that girl children are
        subjected to extreme neglect and disrespect, especially in underdeveloped countries. The birth of a girl child
        is seen by parents as a cause of pity. They are deprived of proper nutrition, education, economic opportunities
        and social status or respect. We must eliminate these prejudices and provide a bright future for girls by
        educating them.</p>
    <p class="one six"> Everyone knows that paper is made from trees. But when one looks at trees, one cannot imagine that something so
        soft and fragile as the paper is made is so hard and strong. Plant materials such as wood are made of fibres
        known as cellulose. It is the primary ingredient in paper making. Raw wood is first converted into pulp
        consisting of a mixture of Cellulose, lignin, water and some chemicals. The pulp can be made mechanically
        through grinders or through chemical processes. Short fibres are produced by mechanical grinding. The paper
        produced in this way is weak and is used to make newspapers, magazines and phonebooks.</p>
    <<p class="one"> Gardening is  favourite hobby. I own a small plot of land next to our house. I cultivate gardening there. Every
        day, I spend half an hour gardening. After returning from my morning walk, I go to my garden with a spade and a
        bucket of water. I prepare the soil, prune the plants, and water them. I also use insecticides and fertilisers.
        My heart leaps with joy when I see the plants swaying in the wind. I feel heavenly pleasure as I watch them grow
        day by day.</p>
    <p class="one"> Home is the place where we return to rest after a day’s work, and where parents and children meet together and
        have a carefree and joyful time. Our family consists of three members—father, mother, and brother. We live in a
        rural area. It is free from the hustle and bustle of city life. It is especially famous for its scenic beauty. I
        am the most important member of the family. Everyone trusts my judgement and agrees to follow my suggestions.

    <p class="two">The teacher of today is the salt of the earth. He wants to create a man, not just make money. He is a
        knowledgeable gentleman. He is an expert in the particular subject he teaches. Though a scholar, he teaches the
        subject in such a way that all students, brilliant or ordinary, can fully understand him. He doesn’t advertise
        his knowledge. He cares about his students and offers assistance to them both inside and outside of the
        classroom. He attends his work regularly.</p>
    <p class="two"> The Dowry system is bad in society. It has turned the sacred matter of marriage into a business deal. The bride
        is regarded as a marketable commodity. Bride’s parents are often put under inhumane pressure for a handsome
        dowry. Sometimes they become destitute to give their daughters in marriage. In many cases, young brides are
        brutally tortured or pushed to commit suicide. To eliminate this social evil, a complete change in society’s
        outlook is necessary. Women should be treated as equal partners to men.</p>
    <p class="two"> Training in a specific branch of applied science, such as engineering, agriculture, weaving, spinning, etc., is
        considered technical education. It contrasts with liberal education which aims to impart general knowledge of
        arts and sciences. In the modern era, technical education is extremely important. Today, a country’s prosperity
        is determined by its industrial development. The more advanced the country is in industry, the more prosperous
        the country is. Technical knowledge is now the backbone of industrial progress, which holds the key to national
        prosperity.</p>
    <p class="two"> After summer comes the rainy season. It lasts from mid-June to the end of September. During this time of year,
        the sky is cloudy. It drizzles and rains cats and dogs sometimes. Rains provide relief from the oppressive
        summer heat. Green leaves are developed by the tree. Ponds and rivers are full of water. Monsoon is a boon for
        farmers. Rainwater softens the soil and makes it suitable for cultivation. Monsoon has some disadvantages. Due
        to heavy and incessant rainfall, the roads, especially in villages, become muddy.</p>
    <p class="two"> An aim is a goal or objective to be achieved in life. To be successful in life you must have a goal. My goal in
        life is to become a teacher. We all know that teaching is a very noble and responsible profession. I’ve
        discovered that our country’s increasing misery and distress is the result of its people’s ignorance and
        illiteracy. So I decided to spread the knowledge among the masses as much as possible within my humble capacity.
        As a teacher, I want to be a loving and respectful person.</p>
