    <p>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played between two teams of
        11 players each who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The
        objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into
        a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played over two
        45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200
        countries and territories, it is often considered the world's most popular sport.</p>
